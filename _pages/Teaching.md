I taught an eight week summer section of Designing Interactions. This class was held remotely, three days a week. We discussed readings, relevant issues and historical perspectives on design, and worked on group projects that made design recommendations on a topic they cared about. I condensed a 16-week, in-person course into this fully remote class. I adapted curriculum, graded, designed the schedule, and held office hours for students.
